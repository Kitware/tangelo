In the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful. 

Praise Allah and pray on his prophet,  

To the esteemed brother, Sheikh Mahmud, Allah protect him  

Islamic greetings,  

I hope this message will reach you, the family, the offspring, 

and all the brothers in good condition. 

I received your first and then your second messages, Allah 

reward you for the totality of what it contained. To start, I 

want to talk about the most important point in our modern 

history, the point of launching the nation‟s revolution against 

the tyrants, and for which I ask Allah to make a start for 

reviving the dignity of the religion and its glory. 

What we are witnessing these days of consecutive revolutions is 

a great and glorious event, and it is most probable, according 

to reality and history, that it will encompass the majority of 

the Islamic world with the will of Allah, and thanks to Allah 

things are strongly heading towards the exit of Muslims from 

being under the control of America, and the Americans worry 

about that, which is great; the Secretary of State indicated in 

her visit to Yemen that, “We worry that the region will fall 

into the hands of the armed Islamists” and that warning was 

directed to „Ali „Abdullah Salih and the remainder of the rulers 

during the revolution in Tunisia, before the revolution in Egypt 

that toppled Mubarak erupted. The fall of the remaining tyrants 

in the region became a must with the will of Allah, and it was 

the beginning of a new era for the whole nation. 

These events are the most important events that the nation has 

witnessed for centuries, as since the nation has entered its  

current stage it has not witnessed any movements to save it that 

are as large as the all-encompassing movements that were 

launched with the grace of Allah these days, and it is known 

that comprehensive popular movements inevitably change the 

conditions, so if we double the efforts to direct and educate 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTthe Muslim peoples and warn them from the half solutions, while 

taking care in providing good advice to them, the oncoming stage 

will be for Islam, Allah willing. 

Page 2 

Knowing that the movements calling for half solutions like the 

Brotherhood have witnessed a spread of the proper ideology among 

their membership in recent years, especially in the growing 

generations, and one of the Brotherhood members discussed that 

phenomenon in a lengthy question among the questions addressed 

to Sheikh Abu Muhammad; also it was mentioned in many of the 

media vehicles that there is a sizable direction within the 

Brotherhood that holds the Salafi doctrine, so the return of the 

Brotherhood and those like them to the true Islam is a matter of 

time, with the will of Allah. The more attention paid to 

explaining Islamic understanding, the sooner their return is, so 

preserving the Muslim movements today and adjusting their 

direction requires effort and attention, keeping in mind the 

necessity of being kindly to the sons of the nation who fell 

under misguidance for long decades. 

That great duty, which is the duty of guidance and advice, which 

is connected to the fate of the nation, does not find he who 

fulfils it aware of the guidance that is disciplined with 

jurisprudence. I have asked in the past that the faithful in the 

nation select from among themselves a number of scholars and 

wise men, who then form a Shura council that follows up on the 

issues of the nation and provides guidance, opinion, and advice; 

but after they delayed in conducting that duty, and the nation 

entered that pivotal stage, it became incumbent upon us, the 

mujahidin, to fulfill that duty and to plug that gap as much as 

we can, which became one of the utmost duties after faith, so 

that the nation is liberated with the will of Allah and the 

religion regains its glory. 

There is no doubt that the duties on the mujahidin are numerous, 

except that this great duty should take the main share of our 

efforts so that we do not shortchange it and expose the nation 

shake-up today, to what the revolutions against the Western 

occupation got exposed to in the past. 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTAnd we have to remember another important issue, which is that 

Jihad in Afghanistan is a duty to establish the rule of Allah 

(Shari‟a) in it, and it is the path toward conducting the larger 

duty, which is liberating the one-and-half billion-person nation 

and regain its holies. So while we are conducting jihad in 

Afghanistan and bleeding down the head of the international 

apostasy, until it reaches such weakness that the Muslim people 

have regained some self confidence and daring, and removed some 

of the oppressive pressure that was exhausting and failing 

anyone who thought of crossing Americas agents, the pressure of 

the supreme power that threatened to keep whom it desires and 

remove whom it desires, and with the gradual deterioration of 

that pressure, the comprehensive revolutions launched at the 

hands of the people whose extreme majority are Islam loving.   

Page 3 

So we have to get into expanding the programmed and directed 

media, and our efforts in directing the nation‟s research and 

deciding on a specific plan that we all discuss, as the oncoming 

stage is important and very dangerous and does not tolerate the 

apparent differences in our directives. Initially I would see 

that one of the most important steps of the oncoming stage is 

inciting the people who have not revolted yet, and encouraging 

them to get against the rulers and the methods, indicating that 

it is a religious duty and a logical necessity, so the arrows 

are concentrated on toppling the rulers without discussing the 

differences on issues, while paying maximum attention to 

spreading awareness and correcting the understanding, and we 

send to the brothers in all the regions to pay attention to 

spreading the book (understandings that must be corrected) by 

Sheikh Muhammad Qutb). 

And due to our efforts in plugging that gap and preparing a plan 

to guide the nation, we must mobilize all the resources that 

have expressive abilities in speech, poetry, visual, or audio 

and devote them completely toward directing and guiding the 

nation‟s youth; and we leave running the work in Afghanistan and 

Waziristan to the resources that have field and administrative 

abilities, and do not have expressive abilities. 

Please inform Sheikh Yahiya and the other brothers who have 

expressive abilities on the previous parts of the message, and 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTinform me of their opinions without missing any of them, as 

every voice that can contribute in this stage should not be 

excluded. 

General points after the second message:  

-  Enclosed is a statement to the nation in regard to the 
revolutions. Please review it and if there are remarks on 

parts of it by the brothers then there is no problem in 

revising it. Then send it to al-Jazeera Network, noting 

that I have enclosed a copy of it in a new card (TN: thumb 

drive or memory card) with nothing else on it, so please 

expedite its release and broadcast due to the importance 

and developments of the events. 

-  Regarding the paper you sent that is titled, “Elements for 
Research Regarding the Arab Revolutions,” it is very 

important, so please start researching it and I might 

comment on it and on all your media activities after the 

revolutions in the next message, due to lack of time. 

Page 4 

Enclosed is a file titled, “Suggestions toward Resolving Crises 

in Yemen,” if you could rearrange the ideas in it and reshape 

them and publish it under your name, or if you do not see that 

as appropriate, put my son‟s Khalid name on it and direct the 

article to the scholars and dignitaries of Yemen. The situation 

requires expediency in that as much as possible. 

-  It would be nice to remind our brothers in the regions to 
be patient and deliberate, and warn them of entering into 

confrontations with the parties belonging to Islam, and it 

is probable that most of the areas will have governments 

established on the remnants of the previous governments, 

and most probable these governments will belong to the 

Islamic parties and groups, like the Brotherhood and the 

like, and our duty at this stage is to pay attention to the 

call among Muslims and win over supporters and spread the 

correct understanding, as the current conditions have 

brought on unprecedented opportunities and the coming of 

Islamic governments that follow the Salafi doctrine is a 

benefit to Islam. The more time that passes and the call 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTincreases, the more the supporters will be of the people, 

and the more widespread will be the correct understanding 

among the coming generations of Islamic groups. 

-  Regarding the operations that the brothers in Yemen are 
intending to conduct using poison, please be careful of 

doing it without enough study of all aspects, including 

political and media reaction against the mujahidin and 

their image in the eyes of the public, so please pay 

attention to the matter. 

-  Regarding the communications with the brothers in Iraq, 
please inform us on its progress and the reason for its 

scarcity. 

-   Regarding the brothers coming from Iran, you are the more 
knowledgeable of the security situation on your side and in 

Baluchistan, so arrange for them the most secure places, 

and Allah is the protector. 

-  Regarding what you mentioned about the British intelligence 
saying that England is going to leave Afghanistan if Al-

Qa‟ida promised not to target their interests, I think 

their stance is similar to the people of Damascus when 

Khalid Ibn Al-Walid entered it, and they became sure of 

being defeated, so they hurried to hold a peace treaty with 

Abu „Ubaidah Allah be pleased with him, so I say that we do 

not enable them on that, but without slamming the door 

completely closed. 

Page 5 

-  As far as the French hostages with our brothers in the 
Islamic Maghreb, I want to warn that the atmosphere after 

the French standing towards the Libyan people does not 

condone killing the French, due to what will follow of 

negative reflections, after it became evident that most of 

the common people are supporting Sarkozy, so if we need to 

kill them then that should be after the end of Libyan 

events and their developments, and the better benefit as 

far as I see is to exchange the woman with the best that 

would benefit you and the brothers there, as far as the 

men, if the brothers can wait, then they should keep them 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTuntil the elections, and if that is difficult then they 

should exchange half of them and keep the other half which 

should be the higher ranking and the more important ones, 

and if that also is difficult then they should at a minimum 

keep the most important man of them till the French 

elections, and it is better that the negotiations not be 

public and that they place a time limit on it so that the 

French do not postpone the exchange till the elections (TN: 

possibly after the elections) so that it‟s a winning card 

in their hands, even though the remaining period to the 

election is not that short. 

-  Regarding the British officer captured by our brothers in 
Somalia, I say that we attempt to exchange him for our 

prisoners with them, or with their allies, so if this 

happens then it is what we want, and if they reach a road 

block and they cannot keep him as a pressure card on France 

to leave Afghanistan before Sarkozy elections, then he is 

to be ransomed with money, and they be made aware of what I 

said about the ramifications of killing the French in this 

stage, even though the reaction to killing would be less if 

the killing was from their side vs. if it is from Al-Qa‟ida 

in Islamic Maghreb side. 

-  It would be nice to ask the brothers in Somalia to inform 
us of the economical situations in the states they control, 

as it is obvious that enabling people‟s livelihood is an 

important part of the religion, and it is the most 

important duty of the Emir, so there must be an effort to 

establish an economical power, and I had in a previous 

message to you written some economical suggestions to be 

sent to the brothers in Somalia, then I did not receive 

from you an indication that they were sent, so if they were 

sent it is important to follow up on them, and they were 

not send because of an obstacle, I have enclosed them in 

the message to resend them to them. 

-  It would be good to send advice to the brothers in Somalia 
about the benefit of doubt when it comes to dealing with 

crimes and applying Shari‟a, similar to what the prophet 

(PBUH) said, to use doubts to fend off the punishments. 

Page 6 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HT-  As far as what you mentioned of the desire of some of the 
brothers to go to the revolution fields in their countries, 

I have written in my message to you before I knew their 

desire the necessity of sending some qualified brothers to 

the field of the revolutions in their countries, to attempt 

to run things in a wise and jurisprudent manner in 

coordination with the Islamic powers there, while studying 

both sides of the benefits and which way is better before 

any of the brothers go. First of all, there must be 

confirmation of the safety of the route, that is for the 

brothers whom we would ask to go, or the brothers who did 

not insist on going, and for those whom you notice are 

highly excited and cannot withstand staying, so those whose 

conditions you accommodate and allow to go while doing the 

best to secure the best safe routes for them. 

-  As far as Sheikh Bashir Al-Madani (Yunis), if the place in 
which he is currently located is safe, then he should 

postpone his travel until the regime in Syria or Yemen 

falls, and as far as the brothers with him, they should be 

dealt with as I have explained in the previous item. 

-  I read the message of Sahib Al-Tayib, and your response to 
it, and it seemed to me that the message indicates that 

some information has been leaked to Sahib Al-Tayib through 

some of the scholars who are connected directly or 

indirectly to the government, or though some of the 

scholars who may have a personal opinion that follows the 

public opinion of the importance of stability in the Gulf, 

so they wanted to hint to Sahib Al-Tayib about the 

seriousness of instigating the situation in the kingdom so 

that he asks us about that, so he in turn only hinted at 

it, that is one way of reading that message, so I ask that 

you read it again in an analytical way and tell me about 

what you come up with by reading it, and also enclose a 

copy of it to Sheikh Abu Muhammad. 

-  Regarding brother Tufan and what you asked of reviewing his 
writings, due to the many duties and shortage of time, I 

will ask that Sheikh Abu Muhammad does that, so please 

enclose the writings of the brother to him, but in general 

I say that the stage now is to spread awareness in the 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTnation after all the flood of good, praise Allah, so it 

should be given attention and good direction. 

-  Regarding Hamzah, Allah reward you for your effort in 
getting him out, and as far as the options you presented, I 

say the third option, which is that he should get out ASAP 

to Baluchistan, where it is only a way to reach Sindh, so 

he should not wait there except long enough to continue 

travel, and should not meet with any of the brothers there, 

and after he arrives in Sindh,  he will contact a person in 

Peshawar, whose number we enclosed in a message to Hamzah, 

to agree on a specific location to meet in Peshawar. 

Page 7 

Then Hamzah will inform the person who will accompany him 

of the place that he agreed to meet with his friend in 

Peshawar to take him to it, and he is a trusted person, and 

we informed him that Hamzah will contact him in the near 

future, and his name will be Ahmad Khan. The method of 

getting out will reach Hamzah in detail when he receives 

his message, which is enclosed. 

As far as him getting training until you arrange for him to 

get out, I say that he stays low in this stage and 

postpones the training to another opportunity, and that he 

does not get out unless for important necessity, and if he 

has to go out, then he should not take his son with him, 

which is what I pointed out to Sheikh Sa‟id in the past 

about distancing the non-concerned with the work as long as 

there is danger, so children would be primarily included in 

that caution, and I had asked for that after there was a 

publication for Al-Sahab that showed a child standing next 

to one of the brothers while the brother was preparing 

explosives, so please draw the attention of all of the 

brothers to that. 

Note:  This thumb drive (TN:  the word used is the same 

word used for telephone SIM card, so it is possible that 

telephone memory cards, which are very small, are being 

used for that purpose) contains a phone number of one of 

our brothers contained in the message for Hamzah, so please 

do not copy the message for Hamzah, and after Hamzah copies 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTthe phone number on paper, destroy the card for fear of 

compromise. 

-  We were told that Hamzah sent you numbers of his brother 
Muhammad, and enclosed with it specific messages, so that 

one of the brothers would call him and relay the message to 

him. So, if there are still communications, it would be 

good that one of the brothers calls him from one of the 

places that are safe to call from, and informs Muhammad 

that Hamzah is telling him that his father wants him to go 

with his mother and siblings to Qatar ASAP, and to live 

there until the situation is resolved soon, Allah willing, 

and that they put the effort in obeying Allah and seeking 

knowledge, and that if it would be difficult to go to Qatar 

then they should go to Hejaz (TN:  Hejaz is another name of 

Saudi Arabia), noting that Hamzah may have other points to 

relay to them and also the words that are between him and 

his brother Muhammad, so that Muhammad is assured that the 

call was from his side. 

-  Regarding the card (TN:  possible ID card) and the license 
that are prepared for Khalid, please hand them over to 

Hamzah. 

-  Regarding the numbers that brother „Abdullah Al-Sindi 
promised, please send them to us. 

-  Enclosed is a message from my son Khalid to brother 
„Abdullah Al-Sindi, and a message from his mother to the 

family (TN:  means wife of) of Sheikh Abu ‟Abd-al-Rahman 

Al-B.M. so please expedite. 

-  Regarding the message that you enclosed to Muhammad Aslam, 
we transferred it to him, and regarding the sum of money 

that you said you sent to him, he told us about it, and we 

might keep half of the amount deposited with us and the 

other half with him. 

Page 8 

-  It would be good if you inform me about the funds arriving 
for the mujahidin from inside and outside Pakistan, and to 

mention the sums coming from each country individually, and 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTof the sums that you mentioned in your message with the 

brothers in Somalia. 

General points after the message before the first message 

-  Regarding what you mentioned in your previous message, that 
the main idea with the brothers on your side was that death 

is better than imprisonment, and accordingly, that a person 

should not get out from the circle of espionage (TN:  the 

operating area of the drones), I say that the correctness 

of the heading does not guarantee the correctness of what 

comes under it, so when the heading is that death is better 

than imprisonment was followed with the assumption that 

leaving the area means imprisonment or capture; while in 

reality it is proven the American technology and its modern 

systems cannot arrest a Mujahid if he does not commit a 

security error that leads them to him  so adherence to 

security precautions makes their technological advance a 

loss and a disappointment to them. In addition to that, 

adhering to security precautions is not an issue that a 

person will commit a human error in, if he really 

understands the importance of his mission and is capable of 

staying in hiding until the situation opens up, noting that 

there is a percentage of people who cannot do that, and 

those need to be handled in a different manner than the 

others, and it may be better to provide them with an 

opportunity in the field. 

-  As for those whom you have observed as being disciplined 
and capable, you arrange homes for them on the outskirts of 

the city, to distance them from the people, which reduces 

the security dangers, and they will be with trusted 

companions, and the companions will have some work as 

cover, as if they lived from it, especially for those who 

live close by and have observing neighbors. 

-  And one of the most important security issues in the cities 
is controlling children, by not getting out of the house 

except for extreme necessity like medical care, and 

teaching them the local language; and that they do not get 

to the yard of the house without an adult who will control 

the volume of their voices, and we with the grace of Allah 

have been adhering to these precautions for nine years and 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HTwe haven‟t heard that any of the brothers were arrested 

after the events (TN:  possibly referring to 11 September) 

while adhering to the precautions, and based on that, you 

can inform the brothers that I say that anyone who can 

adhere to the previous precautions should get out. 

Page 9 

To sum it up, we are tasked with what is better and more 

beneficial for Islam and Muslims, and acceptance of what Allah 

decides, and there is no doubt that there are different views of 

what is better and more beneficial, especially with the 

differences in the fields of work for the brothers. 

Note:  what I mentioned above of arrangements to get the 

brothers out of the area is based on the picture you relayed to 

me in your previous messages, except that you mentioned in you 

last message that there is improvement in the security 

situation, so if that continues, which is what we hope for, then 

what I mentioned above will change according to circumstances. 

-  Regarding the companion, I wish that you expedite arranging 
the matter, as there is a written agreement dated 15 

January 2011, that after nine months from that date we have 

secured a replacement for them to be in our company; and 

you know that arranging for a safe location after picking 

the suitable person takes time, so it would be good if you 

inform me of the developments about the companion in every 

message, and there is no problem if you mention that there 

are no developments. 

-  Regarding your meeting with the brother to arrange the 
affairs about the companion, you should never meet with 

him, but things in general should be arranged through 

correspondence. You mentioned in your last message the 

incident in which brother Riyadh was martyred; maybe it is 

an anomaly that happened, as the incident was contradictory 

to the security precautions that I asked you to implement, 

so please give importance to applying the precautions of 

not meeting any more than two persons and to reduce 

movements as much as possible. 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HT-  Regarding what you mentioned about Inspiration magazine, 
please send to the brothers in Yemen with the pointers to 

remember in that matter and explain to them the danger of 

its effects, in order to avoid repeating it. 

-  Regarding what you mentioned about the file that you sent 
in the past from brother Abu Al-Nur, you were right in what 

you mentioned, and because of that I did not confirm all 

that he said, but in general I wanted to encourage anyone 

that would provide advice, and be keen on handling any 

issue that is disagreed upon by the brothers in a quiet and 

kind manner. 

Page 10        

-  Regarding the operation that Taliban conducted, targeting 
one of the tribes, and what you mentioned of them saying 

that the tribe was hostile to the Taliban; even if that is 

true, the operation is not justified, as there were 

casualties of noncombatants, and due to its contradiction 

to jurisprudence, so please continue you advising of Al-

Tahrik (TN:  another name for Taliban). 

-  Regarding the message of my (late) son, Sa‟d , Allah have 
mercy on his soul, I say that you delete the copies that 

you have and I will attach in my next message a copy that I 

will cut from it what deserves to be cut, then it will go 

to Al-Sahab archives due to the important information it 

contains, which exposes the truth of the Iranian regime. 

-  About what you mentioned regarding the picture of Sa‟d, 
Allah have mercy on his soul, I say that you put his 

picture while he was working in the shop in Al-Sahab 

archives, but you do not publish any parts of it without 

coordinating with us, as for the pictures of him killed, 

they are not to be put in Al-Sahab archive. 

-  Regarding the serious warning that you included under the 
file “serious warning,” Allah reward you, and it would be 

better that you attach such important items inside the file 

of your message to ensure that I receive them and read 

them. 

SOCOM-2012-0000010-HT-  Regarding the French statement, and what you mentioned 
about not being sure that al-Jazeera had broadcast it; they 

have broadcast it and they interviewed some personalities 

to analyze it. 

-  Regarding the poem, Allah reward you with all good; and I 
say that you do not send it to the brothers. 

In closing, I pray to Allah to protect you and guide you to 

what he approves of. 

(TN: Religious farewell)

Your brother, Abu „Abdullah.
